# 4. sum wOrd
# Given a list of strings. Find the strings with maximum and 
# minimum lengths in array. Print the sum of their lengths

# mylist = ["Armenia", "me", "Antarktida","more"]
# n = max(mylist,key=len)
# print(n)
# m = min(mylist,key=len)
# print(m)
# print(len(n)+len(m))    


# 6. New DicT
# Define a function which can generate a dictionary where 
# the keys are numbers between 1 and N (both included) and 
# the values are square of keys. The function should print the 
# dict.Example :
# N = 5
# def myfunc(number):
#     dict1 = {}
#     for i in range(1,number+1):
#         dict1[i] = i**2
#     return dict1
# print(myfunc(5))


# 7. INVERT DicT
# Given an dict. Invert it (keys become values and values 
# become keys). If there is more than key for that given value 
# create an list.Input
# { a: ‘1’, b: ‘2’, c: ‘2’ }
# Output
# { 1: ‘a’, 2: [‘b’, ‘c’] }

# mydict = {"a":"1","b":"2","c":"2"}
# new_dict ={}
# for i,j in mydict.items():
#     new_dict[j] = i
# print(new_dict)
